# <Creating 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler>

## Description

This project aimed to create a dynamic work day scheduler using JavaScript for efficient planning between 9 AM and 5 PM. JavaScript facilitated seamless event updates in specific hourly time blocks, color-coded for past (gray), present (red), and future (green). Crucially, the scheduler stores events in local storage, ensuring persistence after page reloads. Recognizing the importance of organized HTML structure, the development emphasized smooth integration of dynamic elements.The project utilized conditionals, iteration, and event listeners to save data in local storage. Additional skills acquired include integrating CDNs for DayJS and Moment, crucial for maintaining specific classes based on the current time, enhancing user interface responsiveness.In summary, the project successfully achieved its goal of a user-friendly work day scheduler, offering insights into HTML structuring, dynamic element implementation, and effective use of CDNs.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Fontawesome.com, Google Fonts, DayJS CDN, and Moment CDN

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Parvathyaravin/workdayscheduler

## Features

This page allows users to save events to local storage, ensuring that the added events persist even after a page reload. Additionally, the application re-appends the saved data on reload. The display of the current time is facilitated by two CDNs, which, after being utilized and processed through an iteration and conditional statement, result in the color-coordinated time blocks visible to the user.
